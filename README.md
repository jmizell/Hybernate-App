# Hybernate-App
Hybernate allows you to create shortcuts that automatically enable, and disable applications on launch. You will need a home screen app that supports creating shortcuts. Tapping shortcuts created with Hybernate will enable the app, and launch. When finished you can click on the notification to disable.
